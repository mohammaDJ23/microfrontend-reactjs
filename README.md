#### this project has no any production url to show it

#### in the workflows folder you could see some url that refer to AWS, but all of them are a concept.

#### **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**, **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**, **AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME** all of these keys generated by github in the secret section in the setting.. all values you could get from host service websites like amazon, heroku and so on.

#### notic that your path in the host could be in the container/latest by your url that you'r setting in your container.yml file **aws s3 sync dist s3://${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME }}/container/latest**. make sure in the webpack.prod.js file put your publicPath to get access to your file from this url. becuase all your dist files are avalible in this path. eventually the url is something like this: **https://f42309sf90sdf.couldfront.net/container/latest/main.foisdf8972354.js**
